	'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.',
	'Penitentiary chances, the devil dances, and eventually answers to the call of autumn. All of them falling, for the love of balling, get caught with 30 rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin.',
	'I shoot the lights out. Hide \'til it\'s bright out. Whoa, just another lonely night. Are you willing to sacrifice your life? Ahh!',
	'I think words are one of our lowest forms of communication. Music, sound, food, dancing are nonverbal forms of communication. We get so wrapped up into words. We got to make things that are speechless. We have to make things that leave people speechless. We have to make things to the level where no one can say anything.',
	'I feel like this conversation that we\'re having, I\'m not having to use ego, because everything is defined. We\'re on a piece of the 12,000 acres that I own in Wyoming. It\'s different than me being inside a photography studio where previous to that there was somebody posing in their underwear, after that there\'s somebody showing a backpack. There\'s already a comfortability here, and then we\'ve known each other for a long time, and then a lot of what sounded crazy or ambitious at a certain point has already been proven.',
	'The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.',
	'When a child first catches adults out - when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not always have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their sentences just - his world falls into panic desolation. The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And there is one sure thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up again; they never quite shine. And the child\'s world is never quite whole again. It is an aching kind of growing.',
	'I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It\'s when you know you\'re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.',
	'Anything worth dying for is certainly worth living for.',
	'There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was a light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.',
	'Try to imagine a life without timekeeping. You probably can\'t. You know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out.',
	'I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.',
	'Only now is the child finally divested of all that he has been. His origins are become remote as is his destiny and not again in all the world\'s turning will there be terrains so wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to man\'s will or whether his own heart is another kind of clay.',
	'There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.',
	'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.',
	'If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.',
